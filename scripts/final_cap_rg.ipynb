    "Our analysis will focus on how to successfully relocate from one area to another by identifying similar neighborhoods to ease the transition. This analysis would be beneficial for anyone who is looking to relocate or for real estate agents looking to help facilitate relocation. In this analysis, all the user needs to do is update Home town and target relocation spot to run this analysis.\n",

    "In our sample scenario, Dublin, Ohio is a small city just outside Columbus, Ohio. It is a suburb of around 50,000 people and would be more likely to compare to a Neighborhood or Borough within our target area of relocation, Toronto.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, the reason we chose to relocate is that the United States is going through a recent COVID spike that is much larger than other areas. COVID management is different state-to-state here, and we feel it would be best to look outside of the US for a temporary move until the current environment resolves. We chose Toronto based on our willingness to relocate to an area that has the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>1) Similar lifestyle</br>\n",
    "<br>2) Outside of the United States due to the country as a whole continiously posting high COVID numbers</br>\n",
    "<br>3) Ability to speak English while we learn the local language</br>\n",
    "<br>4) Similar weather as Ohio (cold and not super hot summers)</br>\n",
    "<br>5) Proximity to Columbus to visit friends</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to ease the transition, we are targeting a location within Toronto that is most similar to our current residence of Dublin, Ohio. Toronto is a common visiting spot for people within the Ohio area of the United States, and is only a 6 hour drive. This makes it convenient to visit family and friends. \n",
    "\n",
    "During this analysis, we will use our skills to pull data from the internet for Dublin and Toronto, use four square to pull neighborhood venues to compare using K-Means for our ideal cluster of locations, use four square again to find a realtor in our new area, and then use Folium to map our new neighborhoods!\n",

    "Our analysis shows that Dublin, Ohio is similar to a large number of neighborhoods within Toronto. When we review the venues, we see similar themes: bars, a large university (Ohio State and Toronto University), coffee shops, cafes, and more. While this data is helpful for comparing the two areas in terms of similarity, some of the data can be obtained visually. In the folio map we can see neighborhoods that are for the University of Toronto - I am not a student, so we could pass - and others are near the water. The analysis returned a high level comparison as expected of ideal neighborhoods to begin our search.\n"

Since these two cities were chosen for their proximity to one another and similar weather, we could include that as part of our analysis going forward in the event a real estate agent or potential mover did not have a desired city. Some areas to include could be: weather, local language, population, and more."

    "The purpose of the analysis was to find an ideal neighborhood for our relocation. Since we had Toronto selected as a desired city prior given similarity to our current residence and the recent COVID news, we processed foursquare data to show our ideal area. Our current residence is similar to many neighborhoods in Toronto so more information is needed. For this, we chose to lookup a real estate agent to help us start navigating the information, and pull their rating from foursquare as well. We found a real estate agent who had no ratings but we were willing to give them a try as our data pulled back many neighborhoods that matched our current residence. \n",

    "Since this is a large decision, the final decision will come by partnering all available data and reviewing the areas. Stakeholders should look at specific characteristics of a city like venues, proximity to the city, and more. By using a map, like one in folio, additional insights can be gleaned about a neighborhood and added back into the analysis."
